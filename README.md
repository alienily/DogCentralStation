# DogCentralStation

## Overview 
Dog Central Station is a Seattle-based pet store and dog grooming salon focused on providing local and organic food, toys, and supplies for dogs. In 2021, the pet store generated over $3,000,000 in sales, and expanded our inventory to include over 150+ items. The dog grooming business saw an average of 30 appointments per month, with a total annual revenue from the salon reaching $850,000. With the significant growth of new customers concurrent with the rise of first-time dog owners during the COVID-19 pandemic alongside increased inventory, our businessâ€™s current database infrastructure has struggled to scale with the volume of new customers, sales and appointments we record daily. An upgraded database would also allow us to simultaneously pursue additional growth by implementing an email marketing campaign as well as focus on the retention of current customers by being able to filter based on past customer purchases to customize emails on specific sales or new store items.

This new database will record customer information, sales, store inventory, dog grooming appointments and staff management. This data can be used for future business decisions, marketing campaigns, and budget forecasts. The new database infrastructure is capable of recording millions of more data entries and has a 50% faster data retrieval speed compared to the old system.
